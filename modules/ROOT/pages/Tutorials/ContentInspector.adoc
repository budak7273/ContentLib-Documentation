= ContentInspector

You can use the mod https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentInspector[ContentInspector]
to quickly analyze if your ContentLib scripts are loading correctly,
or to examine the properties of used by base-game or mod assets.

See the mod page linked above for more info.

Although the mod shares the ContentLib naming format,
it does not actually require ContentLib to function.

ContentInspector allows you to view recipes that are
stored as Unreal Asset files packaged inside the .pak files of the game and of mods,
as well as recipes created by scripts that do not have any on-disk equivalent.

These recipes do not exist as JSON files,
unlike the recipes you create with ContentLib scripts.
ContentInspector simply renders the content as JSON (or as a widget tree)
to make it easier to understand, view, and export.

Note that fields prefixed with `JS_` are created by JsonStructs
(ContentInspector dependency mod) and contain metadata about the field being inspected.
They are not necessarily 'real' fields on the asset your are inspecting.
They may have been generated by parsing extra objects.

== Examples

=== Locate and Inspect the 'Smart Plating' Recipe

1. Install https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentInspector[ContentInspector] via Satisfactory Mod Manager
2. Launch the game
3. Go to the 'Mods' menu tab
4. Open the tab for ContentInspector and scroll down to find its widget
5. Select 'Pak' in the sidebar because we are looking for a file packaged inside of a mod/base-game
6. Determine where the Smart Plating recipe likely is.
Depending on what asset you are trying to find, the location will change.
Base game recipes are almost exclusively in `/Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/`,
but things like equipment and ammo recipes are elsewhere.
You might have to look around for a bit.
Mod recipes will be in their own plugin folder `/ModReferenceHere/`,
but after that, their location depends on how the mod dev organized it.
In our case, there's conveniently a folder called `SpaceElevatorParts`,
but they're all numbered 1-9 and not named.
We can either look at each one to try and figure it out, or we can...
7. Check the https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Smart_Plating[Satisfactory Wiki]
(or use another xref:Tutorials/FindAssetPath.adoc[asset finding approach])
to find out the internal name of the item.
This name will probably appear in the name of the recipe asset as well.
At the very least, it will appear in the Products section of the recipe,
since it's what is being produced.
According the Blueprint Path field in the wiki's info box,
it's called `Desc_SpaceElevatorPart_1`
We got lucky, since Smart Plating is the first elevator part,
but sometimes the names don't line up like this.
8. Open the `Recipe_SpaceElevatorPart_1` asset with ContentInspector.
9. Examine the fields.
You may need to toggle the 'Use Widgets' option off to see the asset as JSON.
If you're looking for the asset path of this recipe (useful for Patches),
you can get it by modifying the `JS_LibOuter` field value to remove the `Default__` from the path listed there.
We can find out about the purpose of each field from other documentation,
such as https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/Development/BeginnersGuide/SimpleMod/recipe.html[this page].

Please not that it is *not possible to copy paste this directly into a ContentLib recipe*.
The aforementioned `JS_` fields are not real fields,
and ContentLib won't know what to do with them.

You should read the other ContentLib documentation pages for the assets you're looking to create.

=== Inspect Values on an Actor

In this example, we'll look at the stored fuel level in a Jetpack.

1. Install https://ficsit.app/mod/ContentInspector[ContentInspector] via Satisfactory Mod Manager
2. Launch the game
3. Open the game world, construct a Lookout Tower, and equip a Jetpack
4. Fly onto the lookout tower and perch on the ladder. This will keep the Jetpack from refueling.
5. Go to the 'Mod Configs' menu tab on the pause menu
6. Open the tab for ContentInspector and scroll down to find its widget
7. Select 'Pak' in the sidebar because we are looking for a file packaged inside of a mod/base-game
8. Check 'Show Actors' in the sidebar since we want to inspect an instance, not the class itself
9. Check 'Use Widgets' in the sidebar so it's easier to read the output
10. Navigate to the path of the equipment actor TODO paste that here
11. Open the dropdown to reveal the Jetpack actor we're wearing
12. Locate the TODO field, which should match the fill level displayed in the equipment HUD.
